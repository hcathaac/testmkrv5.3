# Source manifest and analytical provenance

## Supplied application

- `archive/original_app.py` is the exact supplied `app(1).py`, retained for comparison and rollback.
- The new `app.py` is the production entry point.

## Supplied R&D dataset

- `data/rd_projects_reference.xlsx` is the supplied workbook `Makryvelios data for R&D Projects and regional development indicators.xlsx`.
- The workbook contains 3,259 project records and 83 source variables after its embedded second-row header is promoted.
- Twelve regions are observed in the project records; the lookup and maps retain all thirteen Greek NUTS-2 regions.

## Research questions and models

- `research_questions.csv` transcribes the nine formal R&D questions EE1–EE9 from `Ερευνητικά ερωτήματα για Stata.docx` and provides English translations.
- `research_hypotheses.csv` transcribes the nineteen hypotheses attached to EE1–EE9.
- `reference_stata/attica_analysis.do` contains project-level Attica models for EE1, EE2, EE3 and EE5.
- `reference_stata/country_analysis.do` contains the corresponding whole-country project-level models.
- `reference_stata/panel_region_year_analysis.do` constructs the region–year panel and estimates EE1, EE4 and EE6–EE9 with Poisson and negative-binomial robustness specifications.
- The supplied analytical chapters and result workbooks were used to cross-check unit of analysis, variables, estimators and interpretation but are not duplicated in this application archive.
- The additional supplied Makryvelios manuscripts on public-expenditure absorption, research employment, innovation outputs, regional patterns and the revised data-analysis basis were reviewed for model form, transformations, robust-inference practice and reporting language. Their methodological links are recorded in `source_evidence_catalogue.csv`; full manuscripts are not duplicated.
- The Monte Carlo portfolio module is contextually grounded in Mavrotas and Makryvelios (2021), *European Journal of Operational Research*, 291(2), 794–806 (DOI: 10.1016/j.ejor.2020.09.051). The app provides a transparent stochastic cost-benefit implementation rather than claiming to reproduce that paper's complete optimisation architecture.

## Renewable-energy and MCDA extension

- Version 5.2.1 adds a schema-agnostic Dedicated MCDA Engine informed by the supplied 2011 dissertation on multi-criteria evaluation of renewable-energy investments and the supplied 2012 dissertation on renewable-energy projects and support mechanisms.
- The historical dissertation evidence includes project/technology/region comparisons and criteria concerning financial return, capacity factor, employment, regional development, avoided emissions, land and grid constraints.
- The production module implements auditable MAVT, TOPSIS and PROMETHEE-II rankings; equal, user-defined, Entropy, CRITIC and AHP pairwise weighting; AHP consistency; weight perturbation; method agreement; and Monte Carlo rank acceptability.
- The implementation is reusable with future renewable-energy or other project datasets. It does not claim numerical replication of the historical dissertations until the original data, exact criteria functions and elicited judgement matrices are supplied.

## Antonis Tritsis programme

- Prior documented scope: 1,454 approved local-government projects through August 2025; €3.76 billion approved budget; all thirteen Greek NUTS-2 regions; Ministry of the Interior source fields covering beneficiary, beneficiary type, region, thematic call, approval date and approved budget.
- `AT-RQ1` to `AT-RQ11` are clearly labelled reconstructions from that documented dataset scope, not verbatim questions from the R&D source document.
- `AT-RQ12` is a new cross-programme research question linking the regional R&D and Antonis Tritsis evidence.
- The Antonis Tritsis project-level workbook was not among the final attached files, so it is not bundled. It can be uploaded directly as XLSX or CSV without code changes.

## Geography

- `data/greece_nuts2_2024.geojson` and `data/greece_nuts3_2024.geojson` are Greek subsets of Eurostat GISCO NUTS 2024 1:1 million boundary files.
- `data/greece_region_lookup.csv` contains bilingual names, NUTS-2 identifiers and centroids for the thirteen Greek regions.

## Reproducibility boundary

The application reproduces the model families and provides auditable exports. Numerical equality with earlier Stata/R tables requires the same dataset version, recodes, missing-data decisions, sample restriction, time allocation, fixed effects and covariance estimator. The app surfaces these decisions rather than concealing them.

## Research Command Chair extension

- Version 5.3.0 adds `research_chair.py` as an isolated free/offline protocol and evidence-scoping layer.
- Spreadsheet evidence is selected from the existing active dataset without mutating the source frame.
- PDF text is extracted locally by page; the selected document, page interval and keyword scope is exported with the results.
- Computable derived variables use a restricted mathematical syntax rather than arbitrary code execution.
- Optional Ollama requests target only a locally running endpoint. No paid or hosted AI service is required.
- Custom prose instructions are documented but are not represented as validated executable estimators.

## Documentation set

- `documentation/COMPLETE_DOCUMENTATION.md` is the authoritative consolidated technical and user documentation.
- The DOCX and PDF editions are rendered deliverables of the same controlled source.
- Focused quick-start, MCDA, Research Command Chair, deployment, validation and requirements guides support operational use without replacing the complete documentation.
- Module 13 exposes the documentation files for direct download when they are present in the deployed package.
