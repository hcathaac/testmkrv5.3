# Makryvelios Research Analytics & Econometrics Command Centre v5.3.0

This is a complete replacement package for the existing Streamlit app. It retains the original R&D data audit, variable dictionary, project/regional modelling, region-year panel, Greece GIS, spatial diagnostics and scenario functions, and adds schema-agnostic multi-file analysis.

## Documentation library

Version 5.3.0 retains the complete v5.2.1 documentation set and adds:

- `RESEARCH_COMMAND_CHAIR_GUIDE.md` — free/offline XLSX/PDF evidence selection, algorithms, safe equations, natural-language interpretation and paper-report workflow.

- `Makryvelios_Technical_Documentation_v5_2_1.docx` and `.pdf` — consolidated technical report and user manual.
- `COMPLETE_DOCUMENTATION.md` — searchable source version of the consolidated documentation.
- `QUICK_START.md` — installation and minimum safe analytical workflow.
- `MCDA_GUIDE.md` — complete operating and interpretation guide for the dedicated MCDA engine.
- `DEPLOYMENT_AND_OPERATIONS.md` — GitHub/Streamlit deployment, acceptance and recovery procedures.
- `VALIDATION_AND_QA.md` — automated and scientific validation protocol.
- `REQUIREMENTS_COVERAGE.md` — requirement-to-implementation coverage matrix.

The full documentation is also downloadable from **Module 13 — Methods & reproducibility** when the corresponding files are included in the deployed package.

## What is new

- A new **Research Command Chair** that accepts research questions, algorithms, equations, ordered steps, limitations and notes without a paid AI API.
- Exact selection of spreadsheet variables, rows and year ranges, plus up to six simultaneous row filters; the original dataset is never modified.
- Multiple-PDF upload with document, page-range and keyword selection, page-level evidence indexes and transparent safeguards for scanned PDFs and quotations.
- Safe derived-variable expressions using a restricted mathematical grammar; arbitrary code execution is blocked.
- Reproducible descriptive, longitudinal, correlation and HC3 OLS protocol execution, natural-language replies, equations and Word/Markdown paper blueprints.
- Optional local Ollama enhancement. The built-in offline interpreter and every statistical/export function remain available without Ollama, subscriptions or API keys.
- A complete Research Chair bundle containing the filtered dataset, selected PDF evidence, protocol JSON, result tables, XLSX workbook and paper blueprint.

- A complete dark postdoctoral command-centre interface with responsive glass/cyber styling and a redesigned, high-contrast multi-file upload control.
- A new **Advanced clustering & segmentation** laboratory supporting one-variable absorption clustering and multivariate K-means, hierarchical agglomerative clustering, Gaussian mixtures and DBSCAN.
- Automatic cluster-number selection with silhouette, Calinski–Harabasz and Davies–Bouldin diagnostics, cluster profiles, PCA/one-dimensional projection and downloadable publication bundles.
- A new **Panel model laboratory** with pooled OLS, two-way fixed effects, random effects, entity-clustered covariance and a Hausman FE–RE specification test.
- A new **Predictive model laboratory** comparing OLS, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, random forest, extra trees and gradient boosting by honest out-of-fold metrics and permutation importance.
- Huber robust regression and Gamma log-link regression added to the single-outcome econometric laboratory.
- Hypothesis tests now report effect sizes, including Hedges g, rank-biserial correlation, eta-squared, epsilon-squared and Cramér's V visualisation.
- Explicit HTML/data downloads and interpretive panels expanded across descriptive, hypothesis, panel, time-series, PCA, scenario and allocation figures.

- A visibly labelled **OLS Studio**: OLS is the default estimator and now has step-by-step guidance, downloadable fit/coefficient/diagnostic tables, observed-versus-fitted and residual plots, a coefficient forest plot, and a colour/black-and-white publication bundle.
- A dedicated **Monte Carlo & uncertainty laboratory** with wild bootstrap, residual bootstrap and parametric-normal OLS simulation. It exports every draw, empirical bias, Monte Carlo standard error, sign probability and percentile confidence interval.
- A stochastic **R&D portfolio selection** tool, grounded in the supplied Makryvelios research context, that propagates cost/benefit uncertainty and reports project selection probabilities plus downside portfolio distributions.
- A high-technology visual redesign, an analysis navigator, module-level operating instructions, interpretation warnings and more explicit table/figure downloads.

- Simultaneous upload of multiple `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.xlsm`, `.csv` and `.tsv` files.
- Reads one or every Excel sheet. Files may be kept separate, appended by column name, or joined on one or more keys.
- Automatic repair of the supplied R&D workbook's two-row header (the `1–83` index row followed by the real variable names).
- Up to 1,000 dependent and 1,000 independent variables can be selected. A vectorised SVD engine performs large multi-outcome OLS screens; detailed models then use robust diagnostics.
- Descriptive statistics, categorical frequencies, correlations and p-values, group tests, categorical association tests and normality checks.
- OLS, WLS, logit, probit, Poisson, negative-binomial GLM, fractional logit and quantile regression; HC0–HC3, HAC and clustered covariance; categorical/fixed effects; VIF and extensive residual diagnostics.
- Original EE1–EE9 R&D project and region-year specifications recovered from the supplied Stata research-question document and `.do` files.
- Official Eurostat GISCO 1:1 million NUTS-2 and NUTS-3 boundaries, bilingual Greek-region matching, interactive colour/monochrome maps, Moran's I and local cluster diagnostics.
- Publication packages containing colour and black-and-white versions in 600-dpi PNG plus vector SVG and PDF, together with the plotted data and notes.
- A dedicated MCDA decision laboratory with MAVT, TOPSIS and PROMETHEE II; equal, user-defined, Entropy, CRITIC and AHP pairwise weighting; AHP consistency diagnostics; weight sensitivity; Monte Carlo rank acceptability; method-agreement tables; and complete publication bundles.
- Self-contained HTML/JavaScript analytical reports.
- PCA, standardised k-means, ADF/KPSS time-series diagnostics, econometric shock simulations and constrained resource-allocation optimisation.
- Optional independent R replication script (`r_engine.R`). Python operation does not depend on R.

## Run it locally

Python 3.11 or 3.12 is recommended.

```bash
cd makryvelios_dashboard_v2
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the environment:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows PowerShell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

The browser normally opens at `http://localhost:8501`. If it does not, copy the URL printed in the terminal.

## Use the data

The package may include the original 3,259-row R&D workbook in `data/`. It loads automatically when the app starts. As soon as files are uploaded through the sidebar, the uploads become the active sources for that browser session.

For the Antonis Tritsis dataset, upload the workbook or CSV and select the sheet containing the project-level table. Choose:

1. **Keep datasets separate** to analyse one workbook/sheet at a time.
2. **Append rows** when files have the same or overlapping columns.
3. **Join datasets on key(s)** when R&D and Antonis Tritsis tables or external denominators must be linked by a stable key such as NUTS code, region and/or year.

Do not join merely on region names if rows have a finer grain. Verify grain and uniqueness first in **Data hub & audit**.

## Deploy on Streamlit Community Cloud

1. Extract the ZIP.
2. Create a GitHub repository and upload the contents of `makryvelios_dashboard_v2` to the repository root.
3. Commit `app.py`, all `.py` modules (including `mcda.py`), `requirements.txt`, `.streamlit/config.toml`, the two research catalogue CSVs, and (only if appropriate) the `data/` workbook.
4. In Streamlit Community Cloud, choose **Create app** and select that repository.
5. Set the main file path to `app.py` and deploy.

The Greece map fetches public boundaries from Eurostat GISCO. If the host blocks that request, upload the required GeoJSON in the GIS module. Do not commit confidential data to a public repository; use a private repository or upload the data at run time.

## GitHub Pages is not the host

GitHub Pages cannot execute Python/Streamlit. GitHub stores the source; Streamlit Community Cloud (or another Python host) runs it. The portable HTML reports downloaded from the app can be placed on ordinary static hosting, but they are result snapshots rather than the live analytical application.

## Statistical limits and honest interpretation

The 1,000 × 1,000 selector is real, but statistical identification still depends on sample size, rank, missingness and theory. One thousand predictors cannot be uniquely estimated from fewer than roughly one thousand independent observations without regularisation or dimensionality reduction. The wide engine therefore uses a pseudoinverse and is explicitly labelled as screening; shortlist models must be re-estimated in the detailed laboratory with robust or clustered inference.

P-values are adjusted using Benjamini–Hochberg or Bonferroni. Results remain sensitive to measurement, repeated regional values, multicollinearity, sparse outcomes and endogenous selection. Associations must not be described as causal without a defensible identification strategy.

## Optional R replication

Install R separately and then install the R packages needed by the selected estimator:

```r
install.packages(c("jsonlite", "sandwich", "lmtest", "MASS"))
```

`r_engine.R` accepts a CSV, a JSON model configuration and an output folder. It is provided for independent checking; the Streamlit app remains Python-first and fully usable without R.

## Recommended workflow

1. Load and audit sources.
2. Select the exact research question.
3. Confirm unit of analysis and construct the project or region-year table.
4. Run descriptive and missingness checks.
5. Estimate a theory-led primary model.
6. Inspect diagnostics and multiplicity.
7. Run robustness estimators and spatial checks where appropriate.
8. Export exact tables and both colour and black-and-white publication figures.
9. Record the dataset version, filters, model configuration and caveats in the HTML report.

## Updating the GitHub/Streamlit deployment

This ZIP retains the folder name `makryvelios_dashboard_v2` for compatibility, but the software inside is version 5.3.0. Replace the old repository folder with the new one and keep the Streamlit main-file path as `makryvelios_dashboard_v2/app.py`. Streamlit rebuilds automatically after the GitHub commit.
